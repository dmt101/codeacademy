            <p>
                Programming skills develop over time. These skills help the programmers to write better code and produce
                reliable software that meets end-users requirements.

                Every software developer needs to go through practical hands-on experience to be good at their trade.
                They have to execute multiple real-life projects to understand the nitty-gritty of good coding
                practices.

            <h5>What is Coding</h5>
            <img src="./image/what-is-coding-1024x683.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without it, we’d
                have none of the most popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the
                browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.
            </p>
            <h4>How Coding Works</h4>
            <p>
                To put it very simply, the code is what tells your computer what to do. To go a bit deeper, computers
                don’t understand words. They only understand the concepts of on and off. The capabilities of a computer
                are guided by on and off switches, or transistors. Binary code represents these on and off transistors
                as the digits 1 and 0. An infinite number of combinations of these codes make your computer work. In
                order to make binary code manageable, computer programming languages were formed. These languages each
                serve different purposes, but they all allow programmers to translate important commands into binary
                code. <br>
            <h4>Is Learning to Code Difficult?</h4>
            </p>
            Coding isn’t that hard for tech-savvy people who patiently put in the time and effort to learn. Coding gets
            an unnecessarily bad reputation from people who weren’t persistent enough to practice. The easiest coding
            languages only involve a few hundred terms and rules to remember. That’s a tiny sliver in comparison to
            learning a spoken foreign language. Once the easier languages are mastered, it’s relatively simple to learn
            other ways to code. Many programming languages use similar methods to code and debug computer applications.
